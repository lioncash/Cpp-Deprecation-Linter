# Searches through directories from a given base directory
# and looks through C/C++ files for deprecated functions and
# suggests alternatives.
#
# This script assumes that the codebase being examined is not
# limited from using C++11 functions, etc.
#
# Further note that this script does not in anyway attempt to determine
# if the function name refers the deprecated function in the standard library
# or if it's part of your actual codebase. However, you shouldn't be declaring
# functions with the same name as ones in the standard library within your
# codebase, because that's just a plain bad idea in the first place. Couple
# it with 'using namespace std;' and you also get pretty niftyâ„¢ clashing possibilities.
# (your little min, max #define re-rolls can be replaced with the ones in the algorithm header, etc)
#
# Further the further note by noting that this will likely produce quite a bit of false positives, as
# this doesn't even lex or tokenize the files. This may or may not change in the future.
#
# For anyone actually experienced in Python, I'm so sorry.
